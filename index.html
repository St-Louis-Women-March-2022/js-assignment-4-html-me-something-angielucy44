      <header><h1>MARIO</h1>"He was my favorite hello and my hardest goodbye."</header>
      <main><article><p>I had always loved dogs my entire life but never was able to have one because of my sister’s allergies. I had to make do with having hamsters and guinea pigs as pets. I would go into my neighbors’ yards to play with their dogs and I would offer to take them for walks. As I got older I became quite a popular dog sitter.</p></article>

      <article><p>Finally, when I was 25 years old, my sister moved out and I was able to get a dog. He was a Cairn Terrier named Mario. My family is Italian and my dad had a great uncle named Mario and that is how he got his name. We got him from a rescue group called Pound Puppies at a Petco store. He only weighed 4 lbs when we (me and my parents) got him and was very sick but we didn’t know that at the time. We took him to the vet and he had pneumonia and a runny nose. The vet said that steam would help him so I would take him into the bathroom and sit on the floor with him while the shower was set to the hottest temperature. The bathroom would fill with steam and this was supposed to help him get better. </p></article>

      <article><p>Luckily he finally got better and grew into the greatest dog ever. Admittedly he was very spoiled but I believe dogs should be spoiled and loved beyond measure. Mario had a wonderful life. We took him to a baseball game and he loved going to the dog park. He was so good at catching mini tennis balls right out of mid-air. He had such a personality and was very stubborn. My dad always said that Mario was a “hard-headed Italian.” As stubborn as he was, he still graduated from puppy school and learned to sit and give his paw. </p></article>
      <article><p>I took him to the Blessing of the Pets every year in October on St. Francis of Assisi’s feast day . There were mostly dogs there but a few cats, a rabbit, and even a turtle. During the pandemic it had to be a drive-thru Blessing of the Pets but we still went. I knew the day would eventually come when I would lose him and I wanted to have all the memories so I got his picture taken by a photographer who worked with pets. I wasn’t sure how it would go because he was quite stubborn, but he was amazing and the pictures were incredible.</p></article>

      <article><p>Mario got older and started to have health problems but he still had quality of life and enjoyed going for walks and lying in the sunshine outside. He had diabetes and had to get insulin injections twice a day. The diabetes caused him to develop cataracts and he was not able to see very well anymore. He knew the layout of the house and still got around really well. Then he started having trouble walking with his back legs because he had neuropathy from the diabetes. His quality of life was diminishing and it would soon be time to let him go.</p></article>
      <article><p>I made molds and ink prints of his paws. I took pictures of him constantly and spent every moment I could with him. I took off work and took him to the park just me and him and then to get ice cream at Ted Drewes. The hardest day of my life was April 15, 2021 when I had to let Mario go. I’ve never felt such sorrow. We arrived at the vet’s office and I could hardly bring myself to get out of the car, because I knew I would be leaving there without him. Our vet office was wonderful and our vet said that she would like to come back in her next life as a dog in my family. I have some of his fur and prints of his nose. I have his ashes in a beautiful wooden box engraved with his picture.</p></article>

      <article><p>I received such an outpouring of support from friends and family who knew how much we loved our Mario. A company that I had ordered dog treats from sent a card and flowers when I told them the reason I was canceling an upcoming order. My dear friends sent flowers and often checked in on me. Losing him has made me even more empathetic to others’ losses. Over a year later I still miss him everyday. I’m not sure if I’ll ever get another dog, but I do know that there will never be another one like Mario. He was worth the 25 years I had to wait to get him.</p></article></main>
