      <p>I had always loved dogs my entire life but never was able to have one because of my sister’s allergies. I had to make do with having hamsters and guinea pigs as pets. I would go into my neighbors’ yards to play with their dogs and I would offer to take them for walks. As I got older I became quite a popular dog sitter.</p>
      <p>Finally, when I was 25 years old, my sister moved out and I was able to get a dog. He was a Cairn Terrier named Mario. My family is Italian and my dad had a great uncle named Mario and that is how he got his name. We got him from a rescue group called Pound Puppies at a Petco store. He only weighed 4 lbs when we (me and my parents) got him and was very sick but we didn’t know that at the time. We took him to the vet and he had pneumonia and a runny nose. The vet said that steam would help him so I would take him into the bathroom and sit on the floor with him while the shower was set to the hottest temperature. The bathroom would fill with steam and this was supposed to help him get better. </p> 
      <p>Luckily he finally got better and grew into the greatest dog ever. Admittedly he was very spoiled but I believe dogs should be spoiled and loved beyond measure. Mario had a wonderful life. We took him to a baseball game and he loved going to the dog park. He was so good at catching mini tennis balls right out of mid-air. He had such a personality and was very stubborn. My dad always said that Mario was a “hard-headed Italian.” As stubborn as he was, he still graduated from puppy school and learned to sit and give his paw. </p>
